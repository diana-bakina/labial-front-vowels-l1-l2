# Rounded Vowel Transfer

This repository contains materials for a pilot phonetic study on how speakers of a language without front rounded vowels produce unfamiliar vowel categories in a second language. The focus is on the acoustic realization of the French rounded front vowels [y], [œ], and [ø].

## Contents

- `stimuli_table.csv` – a spreadsheet of lexical items used as stimuli in the experiment.
- - `scripts/plot_F1_F2_rounded_front_vowels_with_targets.R` – R script for visualizing F1–F2 distributions of rounded vowels, with reference targets from native French data.
- (future) `praat_scripts/` – scripts for acoustic analysis.
- (future) `data/` – formant measurements and annotations.

## Purpose

The study explores how first language (L1) phonetic patterns influence the production of unfamiliar second language (L2) vowels, with attention to:
- Substitution strategies
- Formant dynamics (F1, F2, F3)
- Effects of consonantal context
- Degree of labialization

## Tools

- Praat for acoustic analysis
- R (ggplot2, dplyr, ggforce) for visualization and statistical summaries
- Python (planned) for data processing
